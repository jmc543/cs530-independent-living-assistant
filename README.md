# Independent Living Assistant
Many individuals struggle with living independently. Although systems exist that take on some of the issues that hinder independent living for certain individuals, there is room for improvement in designing a unified, user-friendly system that integrates the multiple components that are required to create an independent living assistant. This project lays the foundations of a component-based independent living assistant system. So far, a Virtual Pill Caddy component was developed that functions to remind users about upcoming medication dosages. This system is designed to connect to a physical, network-connected pill caddy to dispense medication to the user. Other possible components of the system (such as a transit schedule notification system and a meal reminder system) are yet to be implemented. With time and effort, this project has the potential to be a springboard to a fully-featured, truly useful tool to assist individuals in attaining the goal of independent living.
